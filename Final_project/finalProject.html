        <center><p id="paragraph1">As a major app store, Google Play Store provides users with over 2.6 million apps. With some in-depth analysis, these data could be of great use to the app-making industry. This data visualization project provides a clear insight into some of these apps, running the gamut from entertainment to education.</p></center>
        <center><p id="paragraph1">The first visualization is a donut chart, and it shows the number of apps in each category. It is interactive, meaning that users can read the exact number of apps in each category by placing the mouse over the chart. Number of apps in the "family" category is the highest (1747), and the number of beauty apps is the lowest (42).</p></center>

        <center><p id="paragraph1">After the initial exploration, it is worth digging deeper into these categories. The scatter plot below shows the distribution of these apps based on their ratings and categories. Each data point corresponds to a specific rating and category, and the color reflects the number of apps that belong to that data point.</p></center>

During the fall of 2018, as part of my data journalism research for <a href="http://www.storybench.org/">Storybench</a>, a “cookbook for digital storytelling” by Northeastern University’s School of Journalism, I collected Twitter data from 2018 midterm election candidates (with R) to see the possible correlation between the sentiment of those tweets and election results. To better understand these words, a machine learning model was used to predict tweet sentiment, and results are visualized (with Python) and published at <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/news/campaigns/lead-midterms-twitter-republicans-went-high-democrats-went-low">Roll Call</a>. 
You can read my code <a href="https://floriswu.github.io/twitter-sentiment-analysis/">here</a>.

        Our analysis of 130,000 tweets from 68 candidates running for the Senate in 2018 shows Democrats who employed more negative tweets fared better.</p>

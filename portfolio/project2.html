<p>During my time at the Voting Rights Data Institute, I worked on several group projects. 
    For one of the projects, we experimented with the notion of distance between two districting plans. 
    My results are included in <b>"Geometry of Partitions via Optimal Transport"</b>, an incoming paper supervised by Justin Solomon at MIT.
    My write-up and python code of the project can be found <a href="https://github.com/vrdi/optimal-transport/blob/master/Optimal_transport_experiments%20(8).pdf">here</a>
    and <a href="https://github.com/vrdi/optimal-transport/blob/master/Iowa%20run%20version%205%20-%20creating%20plots%20for%20write%20up.ipynb">here</a>.

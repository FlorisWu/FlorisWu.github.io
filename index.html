<div id="London" class="tabcontent">

  <p style="width:65%;">I am a second-year master's student studying data journalism at Northeastern University. I previously completed a bachelor's degree in physics at Imperial College London, U.K. </p>

<p style="width:65%;">Currently, I work as an intern at the <a href="https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/">Harvard Data Science Review</a>, 
  where I design and develop data visualization
 to effectively communicate data science concepts.</p>

<p style="width:65%;">During the summer of 2019, I worked for the <a href="http://gerrydata.org">Voting Rights Data Institute</a>, 
  where I conducted research in the mathematics of gerrymandering by applying data science to social and political problems. 
  While there, I coauthored <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09618"><b>"Geometry of Graph Partitions Via Optimal Transport"</b></a>, a paper supervised by <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/jsolomon/">Justin Solomon</a> at MIT.</p>
  
  
  <p style="width:65%;">Prior to that, I was a data researcher for Northeastern's School of Journalism. A highlight of my experience there is
  a Twitter sentiment analysis project -  
  <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/news/campaigns/lead-midterms-twitter-republicans-went-high-democrats-went-low">"Democrats 'went low' on Twitter leading up to 2018"</a> - that got published on news publication Roll Call.</p>

<p style="width:65%;">I also pursued a machine learning course at Northeastern, which enabled me to develop several algorithms from scratch,
including gradient descent, logistic regression, QDA, LDA, Naive Bayes, perceptron, and neural network.
</p>
    
<p style="width:65%;"> At Imperial College London, I conducted various computing, laboratory and research projects collaboratively and solved challenging physics, math and statistical questions.
    
    My experience studying and working in the U.K., China and the U.S. has also provided me with a global perspective, a valuable skill in todayâ€™s highly-interconnected world. </p>
    
    <p style="width:65%;">Outside my work, I like to cook, box, cycle, and travel.

It also banned state redistricting that dilutes the vote of minority groups.

                                <p>The court had ordered North Carolina to redraw some of its districts because it had been found that their districts map favored Republicans. The new map was redrawn by a Republican mapmaker who had instructions to ensure there was a 10-3 Republican majority in the congressional election. The map packed and cracked democratic voters in order to dilute their vote. North Caroline had gerrymandered its map in such a way that favored the Republican party. The Supreme Court ruled that partisan gerrymandering is nonjusticiable.</p>
